The magic cube is a 3D cube animation created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It consists of six faces or sides, each with a neon blue color. The user can interact with the cube by clicking and dragging on it to rotate it in different directions.

The cube animation is achieved through the use of CSS transforms and transitions. The six sides of the cube are represented as individual HTML elements, and are positioned in 3D space using the `transform-style: preserve-3d;` property. Each side is then given a different background color using CSS.

To enable user interaction, JavaScript is used to detect mouse clicks and drag events on the cube. The rotation of the cube is calculated based on the distance and direction of the mouse movement, and is then applied to the cube using CSS transforms.

Overall, the magic cube animation is a great example of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used together to create interactive and engaging visual effects on the web.
